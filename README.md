### About me
I'm **Lucas** (also called Einstein, Creeperlulu or Epson - it's my fursona's name).  
I'm **18 years old**, french **furry** (protogen) and **student at Epitech**.  
I enjoy **coding, videogames and drawing from time to time**.  
I like **computers** and IT in general.  
I'm also part of the **Scpija** team and the **Oasis** Group.  

I mainly use **Windows** for personal projects but I use Linux at school (no specific distro, I change it every time).  
For now I'm a **Visual Studio Code** user.

### 💻 My current projects
